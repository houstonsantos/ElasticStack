# disable startup delay.

# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publisher", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to stderr. The default is false.
#logging.to_stderr: false

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: false

# Send all logging output to Windows Event Logs. The default is false.
#logging.to_eventlog: false

# If enabled, Metricbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# A list of metrics namespaces to report in the logs. Defaults to [stats].
# `stats` contains general Beat metrics. `dataset` may be present in some
# Beats and contains module or input metrics.
#logging.metrics.namespaces: [stats]

# Logging to rotating files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.

  # under the home path (the binary location).

  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0600

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.

  # Rotate existing logs on startup rather than appending to the existing
  # file. Defaults to true.

# ============================= X-Pack Monitoring ==============================

# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.

# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.

  # timer is reset. The default is 1s.

  # * strict, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
  # authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
  # matches the names identified within the certificate. If the Subject Alternative
  # Name is empty, it returns an error.
  # * certificate, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
  # trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
  #  * none, which performs no verification of the server's certificate. This
  # mode disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be used
